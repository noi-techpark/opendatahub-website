Through real-time, data-driven recommendations, it helps visitors plan their journey by suggesting public transport routes, identifying refill points and pointing to less crowded alternatives to popular attractions. Content is fully customisable, enabling destinations and hotels to update responses in line with their values and sustainability principles. A network of interconnected chatbots further ensures access to verified information across multiple destinations, while instant onboarding makes it effortless to start: a simple QR code opens the chat directly on WhatsApp."

  - description: "Open Data Hub provides Touristinfo.ai with access to essential mobility and traffic datasets, including public transport  schedules and availability, parking information with live traffic conditions, weather and cable cars data, to support service planning and hotspot management. It connects traditionally perceived public stakeholders (such as provincial authorities for weather or public transport) as well as strong consortia and private partners (such as Dolomiti Superski). These integrations allow Touristinfo.ai to deliver accurate, timely and actionable recommendations, enhancing the visitor experience while contributing to sustainable tourism management."

  - description: "The implementation in San Vigilio di Marebbe (https://www.sanvigilio.com/it) shows how Touristinfo.ai can be customised to local contexts: the chatbot “Giggo”, inspired by a local symbol, offers real-time guidance on activities, pet-friendly facilities and route planning. Built on reliable datasets, the system helps distribute visitor flows more evenly, easing overtourism, improving the efficiency of tourist offices and strengthening communication between destinations, hotels and guests.<br>
    <br>
    This is just one example of how data from the Open Data Hub can be transformed into smarter services and engaging experiences.<br>

  - description: "Open Data Hub is much more than a portal: it is a gateway to a culture of openness and collaboration.<br>
    A culture that has placed collaboration at its very core, understanding that openness and sharing generate tangible benefits for everyone, today and, above all, in the long run.<br>
    Open Data Hub means creating opportunities for those who may lack resources but have great ideas. It is a project born of conceptual maturity, one that values collective intelligence and translates into shared benefits for the entire community."
