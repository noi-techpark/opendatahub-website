This integration can lead to innovative new products and make these processes more accessible to individuals who might not have a technical background.” Henri emphasized how crucial this is for smaller and emerging companies, particularly start-ups at NOI Techpark. “These companies need immediate access to high-quality data to overcome initial hurdles and accelerate their innovation process. The Open Data Hub provides that barrier-free access, allowing them to start quickly and innovate faster.”"
