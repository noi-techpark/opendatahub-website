  description: "A new concept is emerging worldwide: 'MaaS' (Mobility as a Service). The idea is to allow people to access different integrated mobility services on demand through a unique app, and to choose the most appropriate one from time to time. This approach is based on open data integration and supports the development of data-driven mobility solutions."

  - description: "The concept of 'Mobility as a Service' (MaaS) has considerable potential in highly urbanised areas, where there is a higher concentration of users. But could it also work in small Alpine communities? And if so, how? These are the questions that the MENTOR project has sought to answer since its launch in late 2018. In order to evaluate the feasibility of MaaS in an Alpine context, the concept has been implemented in two Alpine regions: Merano in the Autonomous Province of Bolzano (Italy) and Brig-Glis in the Canton of Valais (Switzerland). In order to apply the MaaS concept, it is essential that a set of mobility services are strongly integrated around the public transport offer, which forms the backbone of the system. Therefore, the MENTOR project's pilot activities have focused primarily on exploring the potential of new services that integrate closely with public transport and are supported by mobility APIs and real-time open data"

Through a partnership between NOI Techpark and OpenMove, a cutting-edge digital solution has been developed, enabling the calculation of trip plans by integrating real-time data from all accessible mobility services using mobility data spaces. This advanced application is available at [mobility.meran.eu](https://mobility.meran.eu/)."

  - title: "**Bike Sharing**"
    description: "The bike-sharing system can now be provided in innovative ways through digitization and the utilization of electric bikes. In Merano, a new service has been tested since September 2019, which serves mainly to link the city center with the two train stations. As part of the Mentor project, the city of Merano provides 60 bicycles for short term rental free of charge at seven locations using real-time open data and mobility APIs."

  - description: "The test phase showed that a bike-sharing service could be useful in a small alpine town with a high cycling rate. However, to be successful, the service must meet specific mobility demands, such as providing a link between the city centre and the train station, and must complement public transport. A potential challenge for future expansion could be to promote the service in more outlying areas of the city (or even in neighbouring municipalities) by using electric bikes to facilitate longer journeys and support mobility solutions based on open data."

  - title: "**Bike Boxen**"
    description: "To encourage cycling in the city, one issue that needs to be addressed is finding secure bicycle parking. To tackle this problem, a group of South Tyrolean companies have introduced two 'bike box' stations, each of which can accommodate up to 24 bicycles (two bikes per box). Twelve of these stations are located at Maia Bassa railway station and the other twelve are located on the promenade in front of the thermal baths near Ponte Teatro. Use of the boxes is free of charge, but limited to a maximum of 24 hours. The boxes meet high safety standards and also protect bicycles and accessories (such as helmets, bags and backpacks) from the weather. Supported by the Open Data Hub and integrated via mobility APIs, the system contributes to secure, flexible urban mobility solutions. It is recommended that bicycles be locked in the box with a personal padlock as well."

  - title: "**Car pooling**"
    description: "Carpooling is the concept of sharing private cars, connecting people who need a ride with those who can offer one. Although it has the potential to reduce individual car use, organising it effectively can be complex. Thanks to the project, a technologically advanced solution has been developed in collaboration with the company Ummadum that aims to promote local commerce through a system of incentives. Supported by mobility APIs and open data integration, the system promotes smarter, more sustainable urban mobility. Due to the pandemic, a full trial of the new system was not possible and it could only be launched in the final months of the project.<br>
    Although the pandemic severely limited the scope of the project, local companies have shown strong interest in testing effective solutions for promoting carpooling in the post-Covid era. This bodes well for the future expansion of the service. The challenge will be to encourage people who usually drive to rely more on public transport and other mobility options, particularly by using mobility solutions powered by open data to combine various services for a single trip."

  - description: "The pilot phase confirmed that new on-demand services can be an essential addition to public transport, even in a rural alpine context. These services can effectively link the start and end points of a journey (e.g. homes or tourist attractions) with the public transport network. Supported by real-time open data and mobility data spaces, these flexible systems can enhance local transport connectivity. Nevertheless, new and more extensive pilots are needed to confirm this approach, particularly with regard to the economic sustainability in relation to the actual demand for mobility that the service could satisfy."

  - title: "**Self-driving shuttle**"
    description: "In the future, the advancement of on-demand services will be characterised by innovative and revolutionary technology: autonomous, self-driving shuttles. Public demonstrations of this new technology were conducted in Brig-Glis and Merano. In Merano, history was made when a self-driving vehicle with public access was tested on public roads for the first time in Italy. The electric vehicle can ‘read’ the route safely using intelligent sensors and real-time data access via the Open Data Hub. At the end of November 2019, the shuttle was available to interested parties for a roughly 10-minute ride around the city centre from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. for an entire week. Each run transported 12 people, plus two technicians: one to intervene if necessary and the other to explain the vehicle’s functionality to passengers"

  - description: "These demonstrations have shown that self-driving shuttles are technologically mature and ready to provide transport services in specific, controlled contexts. However, further pilot projects are needed to advance the technology and explore its potential in rural and mountainous areas like those found in the Alps. Real-world data pilots of this type are important for evaluating smart mobility in low-density areas. While users appear willing to use this type of vehicle, it is necessary to properly engage them in these projects. Prior to testing the service, 45% of users in Merano expressed low confidence in the technology. This figure decreased to 5% after they had tried it out."
