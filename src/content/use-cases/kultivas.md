  - description: "Due to increasing competition, high demands on the quality of the
    products and environmental protection, efficient and resource-saving
    site selection and cultivation of the areas under cultivation are more
    important than ever.
    KULTIVAS is a Big Data platform for storing and visualising data and
    helps to develop complex forecasts in the field of agriculture in order to
    continue to guarantee the quality of South Tyrolean apples."

  - description: "„Variety-location study“ is the pilot project that KULTIVAS started with,
    asking the not so easy question: Which apple variety is most suitable for
    a location? „The approach is **data driven**, based on three different
    pillars: big data, machine learning and domain experts.“ says solution
    manager and developer Johannes Erschbaumer of the Konverto AG."
