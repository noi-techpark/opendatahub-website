    <br>
    Südtirolmobil (STA) commissioned Open Data Hub (NOI) to integrate real-time bike parking data into the platform and make it accessible via API. The aim was to ensure that cyclists could access live availability data on Bikebox spaces and integrate this information into the Südtirol Pass ecosystem — essential for a comprehensive urban mobility data platform.
    <br><br>
    **The solution:**
    <br>
    To meet this challenge, Open Data Hub has seamlessly connected its real-time data API with Bikebox infrastructure data. This enables live updates on parking space availability, helping cyclists to plan ahead more easily. This integration enhances digital mobility services for cyclists, promoting sustainable and bike-friendly travel."
