    description: "The research center, Eurac Research, headquartered in Bolzano, sought to improve the visibility and accessibility of events taking place within their facilities. To achieve this, it was decided to use data visualization by extending the Today@NOI web component, which initially displayed events at NOI, to events at Eurac. The Eurac-events are now displayed on a screen in the entrance hall in their own design."
