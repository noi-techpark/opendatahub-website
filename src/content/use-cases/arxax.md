  - title: "**Pilot Project: Brenner Corridor**"
    description: "The Brenner Corridor is one of the areas presenting the biggest decarbonisation challenges. Around 2.5 million heavy-duty trucks travel along the Brenner corridor's roads every year. Each of these trucks emits around 150 tonnes of CO₂ per year, making the corridor a key strategic point for decarbonisation at EU and local levels. The Open Data Hub plays a fundamental role in sizing and scoping the green fuel market and analysing fuel demand in heavy-duty transport across the Brenner Pass, using transport datasets and mobility APIs."

  - description: "By utilising data from Autostrada del Brennero via the Open Data Hub, Arxax has the ability to track the number, speed and location of heavy-duty vehicles. Integrating this data with information from Austria enables the tracing of truck routes. This analysis helps to understand demand in specific locations, such as identifying suitable refuelling stations and their optimal placement. These insights help to achieve the ultimate objective of establishing an environmentally sustainable TEN-T freight network with reduced or zero carbon emissions by using open data for sustainability."
