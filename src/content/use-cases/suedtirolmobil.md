  - title: "**The Bingo Project**"
    description: "The Bingo Project is a pioneering initiative in the field of public mobility in South Tyrol. Led by Südtiroler Transportstrukturen AG (STA) on behalf of the South Tyrol province, it is a multi-year digitalisation project. The project's main goal is to lay the groundwork for open data systems that enable communication between different local public mobility stakeholders. Adhering to open standards such as NeTEx, SIRI and GTFS ensures an interoperable data ecosystem. This approach is in line with the European data space vision and the mobility data space initiative. A key outcome of the Bingo Project is the development of digital information channels, including a web portal and native mobile apps, all operating under the Südtirolmobil/Altoadigemobilità brand. These channels have real-world applications and have become some of the most widely used mobility data-sharing solutions in the region. The project has transformed how people access and interact with public transport systems in South Tyrol."
