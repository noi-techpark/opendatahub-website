  description: "The future of public mobility is based on fundamental aspects such as the provision of high-level information to passengers and the integration of a modern ticketing system. However, one important improvement takes centre stage: the new ability to seamlessly integrate points of interest (POIs) provided by the Open Data Hub, into search queries, without the need for precise addresses. The simplification of this process not only transforms the passenger experience, but also broadens the appeal of public transport, marking a significant leap forward in the evolution of transport services."

  - title: "**The Bingo Project**"
    description: "The Bingo Project, a pioneering initiative within the realm of public mobility in South Tyrol, represents a multi-year digitalization initiative led by Südtiroler Transportstrukturen AG (STA) on behalf of the province of South Tyrol. This project's primary objective is to establish the groundwork for open systems that facilitate data exchange among various local stakeholders in public mobility. It adheres to open standards such as NeTEx, SIRI, ITxPT, and OJP, fostering an interoperable ecosystem. This approach aligns with the European Commission's directives on standardised data exchange in public mobility since 2017, ensuring compliance with EU requirements. One of the key outcomes of the Bingo Project is the development of official information channels, including a web portal and native mobile apps, all operating under the brand \"suedtirolmobil / altoadigemobilità.\" These new channels have rapidly gained popularity, becoming some of the most widely used applications in the region. This project has revolutionised how people access and interact with public transportation services in South Tyrol."
