  title: "**Bringing Ideas to Life with Open Data**"
  description: "The ËRT project demonstrates how open data can transform creative concepts into effective solutions. By leveraging datasets from the Open Data Hub, the project transitioned from labour-intensive manual data entry to streamlined, scalable workflows. This innovation has resulted in the creation of interactive landscape models that combine CNC-milled terrain reliefs with dynamic digital projections. These models offer new and engaging ways to explore geographical information using real-world data and data visualisation tools"

    description: "ËRT is a pioneering initiative that creates interactive 3D landscape models to enhance understanding of geographical areas through dynamic projection mapping. Founded by Moritz Brunner, ËRT combines high-resolution, CNC-milled reliefs with digital projections to offer a unique way of visualising and interacting with geographical information. In the video interview, Brunner highlighted the key benefits of using open data, namely the vast quantity and variety of information available and **how easily it can be integrated** into new projects. By leveraging these open data sources, ËRT can provide richer, more comprehensive models that respond dynamically to real-world information."
