  title: "**Bringing Ideas to Life with Open Data**"
  subtitle: The ËRT project showcases how **open data** can turn **creative ideas** into **impactful solutions**. Leveraging datasets from the Open Data Hub, ËRT transitioned from labor-intensive manual data entry to streamlined, scalable workflows. This innovation led to the development of interactive landscape models that merge CNC-milled terrain reliefs with dynamic digital projections, providing fresh and engaging methods to explore geographical information.

    description: "ËRT is a pioneering initiative focused on creating interactive 3D landscape models that enhance understanding of geographical areas through dynamic projection mapping. Founded by Moritz Brunner, ËRT integrates high-resolution CNC-milled reliefs with digital projections, offering a unique way to visualize and interact with geographical information.
    In the video interview Brunner highlighted the **key benefits of using open data**: the **vast quantity** and **variety of information** available, and its **easy integration** into new projects. By leveraging these open data sources, ËRT can provide richer, more comprehensive models that respond dynamically to real-world information."
