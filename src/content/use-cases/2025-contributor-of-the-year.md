  - description: "Matthias’s journey began fifteen years ago, when he joined the project as a young student intern during its earliest stages. Under the mentorship of Roberto Cavaliere, Tech Transfer Digital's Subject Matter Expert in AI and Mobility Solutions, Matthias developed his thesis within the European project *Integreen*, with a particular focus on API design. 
  <br><br>
  From there, Matthias’s career has come full circle. After gaining experience in high-tech companies, he returned to his roots in education and now serves as a computer science teacher at the TFO “Max Valier” in Bozen/Bolzano. For Matthias, Open Data Hub is far more than an interest - it’s a personal mission."
