  description: "Independent L. is an organisation that works daily to make public spaces and **mobility more inclusive** and **accessible for people with disabilities**. While electric mobility offers great potential, it risks becoming inaccessible to some if there is a lack of clear information on the accessibility of infrastructure, such as electric vehicle charging stations."

  subtitle: "Independent L. works every day to promote truly **accessible and inclusive mobility** and **public space for people with disabilities**. While electric mobility is an important step forward, it risks excluding certain categories of users if accurate information on the physical accessibility of infrastructure, such as electric vehicle charging stations, is not provided."

  - description: "The guiding questions for Independent L.’s work are simple yet essential:
  <p>
  _'Is this charging station really accessible? Is there enough space to manoeuvre a wheelchair? Are there architectural barriers?’_
  </p>
  In 2025, Independent L. conducted a comprehensive survey of 822 publicly accessible charging stations in South Tyrol on behalf of STA - Südtiroler Transportstrukturen AG, with the aim of assessing their architectural barriers and actual usability by people with disabilities.

  - description: "A team from Independent L. examined the electric vehicle charging stations in the field, assessing each facility on the basis of 15 technical criteria. These included parking space dimensions, surface type, slopes, signage, cable length and the height of controls.
  <p>
  All the collected data was entered into the Open Data Hub's **Data Browser** in a dataset providing a detailed **overview of charging station accessibility for people with disabilities**. According to the parameters collected and the organisation's technical analysis, each charging station was classified as Accessible (24%), Partially Accessible (22%) or Not Accessible (54%).
