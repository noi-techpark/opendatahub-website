Experimental Bluetooth-based sensors and detectors. Currently located in Bolzano and Merano (soon in other locations of South Tyrol, such as Merano) and A22. Gathered data are then processed to obtain useful information about the traffic, such as total number of vehicles detected and an estimation of heavy and light vehicles.
