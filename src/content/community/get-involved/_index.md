    **​…explore the data in the datasets​**
    <br>
    Choose a dataset from the list of [**Datasets**](https://opendatahub.com/datasets/) and start gathering data from it. You can then provide any kind of feedback on the dataset: reports about any malfunctions, suggestions for improvements or new features, and so on.​ Moreover, if you are interested in datasets that are not yet in our collection, get in touch with the Open Data Hub team to discuss your request.​
    <br>
    <br>
    **​…browse our collection of pre-built Web Components​**
    <br>
    Enhance your website or app with ease: browse the list of [**available Web Components**](https://opendatahub.com/web-components/), choose one that you are interested in, try it out, then send feedback to their developers if you feel something is wrong or missing.​"

Let your Open Data be freely used by App Developers in their applications.​
    <br>
    <br>
    Note: A [**Data Provider**](https://opendatahub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datasets.html#data-providers) is an entity (be it a private company, a public institution, or a citizen) that gathers data on a regular basis from various sensors or devices and stores them in some kind of machine-readable format."

    description: " **​…harvest data exposed by the dataset.​**
    <br>
    Browse the list of [**Datasets**](https://opendatahub.com/datasets/) to see what types of data are contained in the datasets, and think how they can be used.​ For this purpose, we maintain an updated  list of available [**Datasets** ](https://opendatahub.com/datasets/)with links to the API to access them.​
    <br>
    <br>
    **…build an application with the data.​**
    <br>
    Write code for an app that combines the data you can harvest from the available datasets in various, novel way.​
    To reach this goal, you need to access the APIs, their documentation, and the datasets. It is then your task to discover how you can reuse the data in your code.​
    <br>
    <br>
    **​…integrate Open Data Hub data using Web Components.​**
    <br>
    The Open Data Hub team and their partner have developed a [**library of Web Components**](https://webcomponents.opendatahub.com/) that can be integrated in existing websites or used as guidance to develop new Web Components.​
    <br>
    <br>
    **​…publish my app in Open Data Hub.​**
    <br>
    As soon as you have developed a stable version of your app, get in touch with us: We plan to maintain an updated list of apps based on our dataset.​
    <br>
    <br>
    ​No software installation is needed. Develop in a language of your choice an application that uses our data."

  - title: "As an Open Data Hub Core Hacker I can…​"
    description: " **…help shape the future of Open Data Hub.​**
    <br>
    Participate in the development of Open Data Hub: Build new data collectors, extend the functionality of the broker, integrate new datasets on the existing infrastructure, develop new stable API versions.​
    <br>
    <br>
    To be able to become a core hacker, however, requires a few additional tasks to be carried out:​
    <br>
    <br>
    1. ​Learn how to successfully integrate your code with the existing code-base and how to interact with the Open Data Hub team. In other words, you need to check the [**Developer’s Flight Rules**](https://github.com/noi-techpark/documentation/blob/main/README.md)​
    <br>
    <br>
    2. Understand the Open Data Hub **_Architecture_**
    <br>
    <br>
    3. Install the necessary software on your local workstation (be it a physical workstation, a virtual machine, or a Docker instance), including PostgreSQL with postgis extension, JDK, git.​
    <br>
    <br>
    4. Set up all the services needed (database, application server, and so on).​
    <br>
    <br>
    5. Clone our git repositories. To successfully complete these tasks, please read the **_[How to set up your local ](https://opendatahub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/generic/development.html#development)[Development Environment](https://opendatahub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/generic/development.html#development)_**  tutorial, which guides you stepwise through all the required set up and configuration, along with some troubleshooting advice.​
    <br>
    <br>
    6. Coding. That’s the funniest part, enjoy!​"
