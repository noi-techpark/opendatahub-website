    description: "It is with great pride that we gather here today to present the “Open Data Hub Contributor of the Year” Award 2025. <br>
This recognition honours not just individual excellence, but the enduring spirit of community, dedication and openness that powers the entire Open Data Hub ecosystem.<br>
We celebrate those who not only contribute technically, but also make Open Data Hub tangible — not just as a concept, but as a tool to build with, to learn from, and to share. Those who pass on what they know, bring it into the classroom, and spark curiosity in the next generation — keeping alive the values of Open Data, Open Source and Open Standards.<br>
This year’s recipient has been with the project from the very beginning — literally. As a young student, he joined our team as an intern, when the Open Data Hub first took shape back in 2010 (15 years ago!). It was then, guided by Roberto Cavaliere, that he developed his thesis within the European project “Integreen”, focusing on API design.<br>
Since then, his journey has come full circle. Collecting his experience in high-tech companies and now, as a computer science teacher at the TFO “Max Valier” in Bozen/Bolzano, he continues to pass on his passion and expertise to new generations. Open Data Hub is not only part of his curriculum — it’s part of his mission.<br>
Thanks to his initiative, students at the “Max Valier” Bozen/Bolzano regularly build Open Source applications using real-world Open Data Hub datasets. Today, two of them — David Spitaler and Elias Klotz — are presenting their school project “Open Quiz Hub” right here, at the Open Data Hub Day 2025.<br>
In recognising him as the Open Data Hub Contributor of the Year, we pay tribute to a long-standing contributor who has never stopped believing in the value of openness and education. His story shows how early engagement in Open Source projects can evolve into a lifetime of impact.<br>
And now, it is my great honour and privilege to announce that the Open Data Hub Contributor of the Year 2025 is… <b>Matthias Dieter Wallnöfer</b>.<br>
Congratulations Matthias! Your commitment and enthusiasm are lighting the way for the next generation.
