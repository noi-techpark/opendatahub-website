      - Sprint 1 (weeks 1-2): basic configuration of the data collector
      - Sprint 2 (weeks 3-4): development of the adapter part with respect to the customer’s API
      - Sprint 3 (weeks 5-6): development of the adapter part of the Open Data Hub API
      - Sprint 4 (weeks 7-8): testing and production start of the application"
