    Since 2010, Open Data Hub has stood for innovative solutions in the field of Open Data and is now an important partner of companies, research institutes and developers at an international level.
    <br>
    The Open Data Hub project began in 2010 with the aim of grouping data collected from a series of European projects in the field of mobility research and development.
    <br>
    In 2016, tourism data was added, significantly expanding the resources available on the platform.
    <br>
    These datasets have come from multiple sources, often via complex APIs and Open Data Hub has translated them into well-documented Open Specification APIs, supporting the work of developers creating apps, websites and other systems.
    <br>
    Today, the main objective is to turn bold ideas into impactful realities by expanding data collection and exchange at an international level, within the **Data Spaces**: Mobility, Tourism, Agriculture and more."

  - description: "The main issue we try to address is that people who develop advanced apps, with advanced algorithms, also need data (if possible, simple and of high quality.) Otherwise the algorithms and the related innovative business models do not work. Thanks to the Open Data Hub, we try to provide a large amount of high quality data, reducing the so-called „cold start problem.“"
